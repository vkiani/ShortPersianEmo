# ShortPersianEmo

The code and data in this project are related to the following research article, in which firstly ShortPersianEmo a new data set for emotion recognition in Persian short texts is introduced, and secondly shallow learning and deep learning models are evaluated for emotion recognition in Persian short texts:

The ShortPersianEmo dataset is a single-label dataset that contains 5472 short Persian texts collected from Twitter and Digikala. Our dataset is annotated according to Rachael Jackâ€™s emotional model in five emotional classes happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and other.
Unlike publicly accessible datasets that do not impose any restrictions on text length, ShortPersianEmo specifically focuses on short texts. The average text length in the ShortPersianEmo dataset is 56 words. Table 1 presents a comparison between the introduced ShortPersianEmo dataset and other datasets from the literature for emotion detection in Persian text.
